		This application is a minimum viable product (MVP)! This means that all non-functional requirements were not a priority and it is only tested in the latest Chrome, Firefox and IE browsers.
		For example if the Hacker News API does not return data for any reason the application must be refreshed. The technology stack includes frameworks, libraries and tools like – Underscore, jQuery, Backbone, Backbone Layoutmanager, Handlebars, Twitter Bootstrap, Twitter Bower, RequireJS, and Grunt.
		<br/>
		<br/>
		The application returns news from the Hacker News homepage since the newest entries mostly do not have any comments. The application interprets ’20 top comments’ as the first 20 comments returned by the API without ordering them somehow. Moreover, the comments text is not formatted appropriately in this version. This is considered a feature that must not be part of the MVP.
		<br/><br/>
		The application structure is inspired by Backbone Boilerplate with some modifications like working with precompiled Handlebars templates, using Bower for managing dependencies, some changes in the Require JS approach etc.
